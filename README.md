# Crowdfunding-ET

# Purpose

This week's challenge allowed us to exercise the full ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline in one final activity.
We were able to:

* Extract and clean the output files from this week's online work
* Transform that data into 4 DataFrames which were then exported a 4 seperate CSV files
* Create an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) giving us a logical diagram of our new database
* Create a PostgreSQL database and table based on our ERD, and our CSV files
* Provide the required analysis by writing SQL queries to generate reports for out stakeholders

* Results

This activity resulted in the following data outputs:
* category.csv
* subcategory.csv
* campaign.csv
* contacts.csv
* backers.csv

The database outputs included the ERD

Also included were the final tables resulting from our SQL queries - [Link to Queries](https://github.com/SusanFair/Crowdfunding-ETL/blob/main/crowdfunding_SQL_Analysis.sql)

As well as the actual tables of results to be provided to our stakeholders.
